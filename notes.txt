CS390 Notes

IBM 360 Project: devlop an OS that is scalable across the size of the machine, when upgraded, you didn't need a new operating system 

If you make a system too big/general, it becomes difficult to manage 


UNICS: Smaller version of MULTICS, more scaled down and simplistic 

UNICS kernel developed by 1 person 

C was never intended as a general purpose language 

Programming language should be readable

C is still one of the top programming languages even though it doesn't have a lot of the features in other modern languages 



API: Application Program Interface: function signature. What defines the prototype for a procedure
Function signature: the name, and the number/types of parameters 

In C, the return type is NOT part of the function signature 
In ADA, the return type IS part of the function signature 

A procedure has no return value, a function has a return value 


In C, everything is a function. EVERYTHING 

Richard stallman invented GNU 
He said that code shoud be free 
GNU Code base: a set of tools that were free. Rules: you can give this code away to anyone you want but if you modify it you must give the code away to anyone who uses it




POSIX: Specification that sought to bring together into one single unified API the unix OS

Features of Unix:
1. Process: any program running on a system 
2. Text based: everything in unix is a text file 
3. Simplifying assumptions. Everything in Unix is a file 
4. Pipe: simple, single use functions

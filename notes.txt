S390 Notes

IBM 360 Project: devlop an OS that is scalable across the size of the machine, when upgraded, you didn't need a new operating system 

If you make a system too big/general, it becomes difficult to manage 

UNICS: Smaller version of MULTICS, more scaled down and simplistic 

UNICS kernel developed by 1 person 

C was never intended as a general purpose language 

Programming language should be readable

C is still one of the top programming languages even though it doesn't have a lot of the features in other modern languages 



API: Application Program Interface: function signature. What defines the prototype for a procedure
Function signature: the name, and the number/types of parameters 

In C, the return type is NOT part of the function signature 
In ADA, the return type IS part of the function signature 

A procedure has no return value, a function has a return value 


In C, everything is a function. EVERYTHING 

Richard stallman invented GNU 
He said that code shoud be free 
GNU Code base: a set of tools that were free. Rules: you can give this code away to anyone you want but if you modify it you must give the code away to anyone who uses it




POSIX: Specification that sought to bring together into one single unified API the unix OS

Features of Unix:
1. Process: any program running on a system 
2. Text based: everything in unix is a text file 
3. Simplifying assumptions. Everything in Unix is a file 
4. Pipe: simple, single use functions


Windows is not text based, relies on registry (database of keys)

Cygwin, WSL are both bash shells for windows 


Unix shell operates on a text buffer, and control sequences operate on that buffer



Basic commands
echo, displays its arguments


tar file (tar ball) is what source code is stored in


$ represents prompt for std user 
# represents prompt for root

cd: change working directory 
pwd: print working directory
mkdir: make directory
ls: list items in directory

cd is shell command, cwd is the system call referred to by the shell command 


shell > library > system call //order of hiearchy, shell calls library calls system call

Everything in unix is a function. A function returns a value. 
This means that unix functions return an exit code. 

When your int main() returns 0, it means nothing bad happened. You can return different values to represent failure 


#define is not a bad thing 

Using a logical or with a bitmask and value will tell you if certain values are set or not 

S_ISREG, S_ISDIR, S_ISFIFO, S_ISLNK, S_ISSOCK


& is the logical and, NOT the relational and (&&) 

struct is an aggregate data structure 


meld: file comparison for linux

beyond compare: file comparison tool that is proprietary 



Unix architecture 

Hardware is at center, kernel runs on hardware
System calls and API run on hardware 

library runs on system calls and api 

shell is a tool that comes with linux, runs on system calls to kernel 

Applications run on shell 


Bottom of page 19 explains library vs system calls 




$PATH: colon delimited file 

Shows all directories that shell should search for executable programs 


Two special directories: 
. --> current directory
.. --> parent directory 


Unix uses a single directory hierarchy. Everything is in the / directory
Unlike windows: windows has C:/, D:/ etc 

Push down complexity: to make something easier for the user, push the complexity down to a lower level 

. directory is not in path, because malicious program could be executed instead of the system program with the same name 

./prog runs prog located in the local directory 
$ prog runs prog located in path 


Windows: something that runs is called an executable  (.exe)
In *nix, an executable program is called an image 



Kernel cannot tell if an image is a binary executable or a shell script 

Put .sh extension on shell scripts to make searching easier 



File * f;
f = fopen(fn."rb");

^^^ this checks if a file can be opened in binary mode 


which progname #strictly searches path to check if program name is in path 

/usr is unix programs 
/usr/bin is unix binaries
/usr/lib/ is library functions
/usr/include is include functions 
/usr/local/bin has things that are standard to a unix system, or anything you've installed yourself 


whereis searches standard unix directories as well as path (also looks into documentation directories)


[ is a function 

Performance can be optimized in an OS by disabling certain system functions 

Always read the man page if you're not sure about an option

backslash \ is the continuation character, allows you to type a command on multiple lines 



man pages are documentation for a program 
Divided into sections  (can be quirky)

less is a pager to view stdout


UNIX FILE SYSTEM 

File model:
Input goes through a transform to go to an output 

Kernel system calls are read, write, close



fd

Device driver executed using file descriptor 

Types of files:

Ordinary files: 2 types: text file and binary file 
Directory Files: 
Device Files (looks and behaves like a file on the interface level, but when opened, you get the file descriptor index, operates differently than other files)



File is seen by computer as an array of bytes
A byte is the fundemental unit of data 
A byte can represent 256 different numbers (2^8)

Realized soon after invention that computers can do symbolic computing as well as numeric computing 


ASCII: American Standard Code for Information Interchange 
Each number gets a character 

ASCII 48-57 DEC represents 0-9 digits 
ASCII digits are not intended to do math, but instead for representation of numbers as text 

Foremost bit in an ASCII character (the most significant) is an 0, represents ASCII. 

Above 127 is vendor defined ASCII, not standard. Depends on the vendor 

0-31 are control characters, such as control, CR, backspace, delete, etc

fopen in C with option 'b' reads carriage returns, otherwise \n are interpreted as is

Carriage return stems from typewriter, when you hit the end of a line, the carriage returns across the page to start the next line 

In unix, you only have a line feed, no carriage return 


Directory has a table of file names and poitners to i-nodes (struct)

If a file/directory begins with a ., it is a hidden file. 

Files are not contiguous on a disc drive. 


/bin: standard binaries
/sbin: admin applications
/usr/local/bin: software you install 
/etc contains all system config information in text files
/dev contains device driver interfaces 
/tmp contains temporary files


Any file on a linux system is accessible via the / path
Relative file path is the file path relative to where you currently are in the system 



pwd is print working directory
cd is change directory

Config files are hidden files/folders in ~/

. represents the current directory 
.. represents the parent directory 

File permissions 

3 file permissions:
User Group Other

Each has 3 access levels: rwx

Something accessible to you is accessible by everyone else in the group 

Read: you can see the fil e
Write: You can edit the file 
Execute: executable file cannot run without this bit being set

An image in unix  is a compiled program ready for execution 


Schebang: used to show that a file is a script, not a bin file 
#!/bin/bash


chmod == change mode

umask REMOVES permissions
Modifies permissions by removal

Know what a umask does 

666 is default for regular file, 777 for directory 

Google default umask 


3 more permission bits 

set UID bit tells who can run the file 



Text vs Bin file: text file has only printable textual characters in ascii table
Control characters come before characters, and are non-printable


Function in C library called "isprint", checks if something is a printable character 

Set UID: when this bit is set, you can run the file with the permission of the user who owns it 


passwd program MUST be run as su

Hard Link:

Say you have multiple file names pointing to the same iNode on a disk 
iNode keeps a count of the number of pointers to the inode. The inode only gets removed when the inode reference count goes down to zero 

DOES NOT WORK ACROSS MULTIPLE FILE SYSTEMS


Hard link command: 
ln existingfile newfile


Soft links (symbolic links)
Unix is a singly rooted hierarchy.

symlink:looks up real filepath and then goes there




When you log in, your username is convreted to a number, which is stored in the inode 


find command
find <root dir> <options> <action> 
		-name <filename>

Angle brackets are required commands
regular brackets are optional commands 

<root dir> is where find command starts 
<options> are run options
<action> is what the shell should do 

Wildcard expansion is called globbing 


Double quotes or single quotes do not expand a wildcard (*)

-exec lets you execute an option on the found files 

-name finds by name, 
! -name finds by not name 



Regex
filename[123] finds any file called filename ending with 1 2 or 3
* matches any characters including 0 characters
Page 159 has a list of regex 

Although you CAN use meta characters in file names, don't. 

Double quote interprets the dollar sign and the cmd substitution symbol (backtick), but will not interpret wildcards  "$`<command`>"

Single quote does no interpretation whatsoever 


0: stdin is open when you start a program 
1: stdout
2: stderr

stdout: output of command
stderr: error messages only 

You don't know/dont care where the data stream is coming from or where it's going 

P171 has info on redirection 
stderr and stdout are separate file streams
Allows for output to go to 1 file and errors to another 

1>&2 sends stdout to stderr 
2>&1 sends stderr to stdout 

Commands can be grouped with parentheses 


/dev/null is a file that incinerates anything piped into it 
/dev/null is a pseudo device, does not represent a physical device 


/dev/tty forces to terminal output 

forces output to go to terminal device regardless of where output of program is going. If you have a program going to a file, you can redirect output inthe script to /dev/tty and it will allow you to output the text to the termianl. 

To write a pipe in c

int main()
{
	char input[512];
`	while(fgets(input, sizeof(input), stdin))
	{
		//do stuff here
	}
	return 0;
}


tee allows you to duplicate output to both stdout and redirected output 

Command substitution
$ echo "File count = `ls | wc -l`"
Allows you to turn a command into data 


echo $PATH shows you the path output 
echo "$PATH" prints $PATH  (verbatim)

$ HERE = $PWD
$ HERE = `pwd`

Both of these ^^ do the same thing 


If copying files from one place to another, consider settings $HERE and $THERE variables 

Shell vars should be in upper case (general convention)


Shell variables defined at login are called environment variables 


$ configure --prefix=$HOME/bash 
$ make
# make install 

^^ this prefixes $HOME/bash to the install directory 

Page 182: Shell's treatment of the command line 
IMPORTANT READ THIS 

Steps to treate command line
1. Parsing: break up using spaces and tabs as delimiters
2. Variable evaluation: evaluate any $vars and replace with their values 
3. COmmand substitution 
4. Check for redirection (<, >, <<, >>, |)
5. Wild card interpretation (done by glob)
6. Path evaluation 

xarg breaks up arguments and feeds them into stdout


Midterm will cover up to page 184

Study methodology for midterm 

1. Look at quizzes. Quiz questions will be replicated on midterm. 
2. Look at lecture notes 
3. Look at book. 

A few topics discussed during the lecture are not in the book. 


Definitions, questions, potentially some code snippets 
Shell commands are fair game

Process
Page 188

On boot, init is bootstrapped which starts up booting 

process names that end with d are a daemon 


Fork: program that is running is the same as the subprocess 


PPID: parent process ID

Parent can flow to child, but child cannot flow to parent 

Fork creates process
Exec overlays with the new program 
Wait pauses execution until process returns a completion code 


int errno is a global variable

extern means that it is a declaration, not a definition 

Definition allocates memory, declaration does not 

zombie process is waiting for the parent to do a wait on the child


Every process has UID and GID, tells what permissions that program has 

passwd is a program that belongs to root. If setuid bit is set, run programs with permissions of owner

By default, user defined variables are not inherited by child processes 


Zombie process cannot be killed

Orphan is where parent dies but child is still running. 


ENV vars that exist to offer configuratio info for given process 


Attributes flow down but do not flow back up again 

if in parentheses, kicks off subprocess (child) 

(cd $dir; pwd);pwd will print out current directory
cd $dir;pwd;pwd will print out dir 



DO NOT TERMINATE PROCESS UNLESS YOU HAVE TO

 
#include <iostream>
bool AbortFlag = false;
void SetAbort(int sig)
{
	Abortflag = true;
}

int main()
{
	int i;
	...
	...
	signal(SIGINT, SetAbort); //^C interrupt, name of function to go to when that signal is entered. 
	
	return 0;
}



extern bool Abortflag; //I am using this term but it's not defined in this compilation unit 


$ <command>& #runs a command independently of terminal, in the background.
$fg <PID> #brings that process to the foreground again 

at: runs command at given time 

cron: scheduling tool to run tasks continuously at given time intervals 
token: a piece of information in textual form 


crontab: tells you whats in the cron table
